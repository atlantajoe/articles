When you're younger, you feel that you're invincible. The world may push against you, but nothing will stop you. You build a career, find success, and thrive on the connections you make. Every client, every interaction, every challenge fuels your passion and makes you want to do more.

It's not an arrogance, nor smugness - it's a joyful pride. The kind that comes from doing meaningful work, making an impact, turning frowns into smiles. You go to bed at night excited for tomorrow, eager for what's ahead.

But then one day, everything changes.

Maybe you were having so good of a time that you ignored your health for too long. Maybe it was bad luck. Either way, you find yourself in the middle of a perfect storm - and suddenly, the invincibility you once had starts to fade away.

For me, that moment came in an instant. One minute I was riding high in good spirits. The next, I was headed to the emergency room, trying to do anything to stave off the worst headache of my life.

Two strokes.

I still thank my lucky stars - I know I could have ended up in a much worse place. But I didn't, and I had to accept what came next: learning how to live with a stroke.

## Adapting to a New Reality

Walking and standing were difficult for me then and now. Driving, especially navigating Atlanta's chaotic traffic would send me into a full-blown panic attack. Oh yeah, I get those too. My life looks very different that it did before.

Before I could learn how to adjust, I had to heal. I spent months watching television, giving my body time to recover. But knowing me, I wasn't going to sit in front of the TV and just watch. All my life, I had to be doing. I had to be learning.

Then I turned to my computer. I had always wondered what it took to make a website. So, I started learning that. HTML and CSS. Eventually, I got a little tired of that. So, I switched and started writing articles online, keeping my brain engaged.

At first, I could only stay awake for three hours at a time. I'd nap, wake up for two hours, nap again. And repeat that throughout the day. When I was awake, I tried to spend time with my family, but they told me that I wasn't the easiest person to be around especially during those early days. So, I often stayed in my room, adjusting alone.

One unexpected benefit? Using my computer helped me regain motor skills in my left hand. Little by little, moving a mouse, typing, practicing - until finally, I could type with both hands again. It's the little successes that mean a lot, you know?

## Technology as a Lifeline

Over time, my routine became a rhythm:

- Shifting between web development and writing

- Coding practice websites, publishing them on GitHub and Netlify

- Watching YouTube videos, learning more about development

- Writing articles, processing everything I was going through



That rhythm kept me going. And now, eight years later, I'm still learning how to cope with the aftermath of my stroke.

I've made progress - slowly but surely. I have my good days, and I have my bad days just like everybody else. I finally got a handicapped parking placard, though I can't shake the guilt when I use it. Some part of me whispers, "Someone out there needs this spot more than you do." I know it's irrational, but it lingers. Still, I do what i have to do.

Through all of this, My computer has remained my constant. To most, it's just machine. To me, it's an open door to the outside world. A way to navigate the world without leaving my home. A means for me to learn, create, contribute, and stay engaged.

I may not always be productive in the broad sense of the term. I may not be solving the world's problems. But hey, those videos on YouTube aren't going to watch themselves. But I'm always trying to move forward - whether it's through writing or coding, learning, or simply experiencing life through a screen.

And maybe, with enough coffee, I'll keep at it just a little longer.
